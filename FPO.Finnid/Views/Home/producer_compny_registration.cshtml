                                            If someone wants to start a FPO (Farmers Producer Organization), it can be started in many
                                            ways like as a cooperative society, company, ngo as society registration act 1860, ngo as
                                            trust, ngo as section 8 company etc.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If a FPO (Farmers Producer Organization) is registered under Companies Act, 2013; it is known
                                            as Farmer’s Producer Company (often referred to as FPC).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The concept of FPC was started up with a positive intent of giving corporate shape to agri
                                            business, giving a bridge to agri entrepreneurs to connect them with main line of business.
                                            FPC is hybrid of a FPC & public limited company.

                                            Account Number) like we have. Most of the work it can do what we can do as a natural person
                                            except natural process. It can contract; It can sue & be sued. Like we are bound with laws of
                                            society, it is bound with the laws of Companies Act, 2013. It has its own constitutional

                                                <p>The Income Tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) specifically exempts tax on agricultural income under Section 10(1). However, the exemption for such agricultural income shall sometimes vary depending upon the kind of agricultural activity carried on. It is to be noted that though the IT Act does not per-se give any special benefits or exemptions to Producer Companies as such, but depending upon the kind of agricultural activity it carries on, certain tax benefits can be availed. Dividend tax at the applicable rates is required to be paid by the Company at the time of patronage bonus, limited return distribution and the same will be tax free in the hands of the members. Bonus shares will not attract any tax in the hands of the members at the time of allotment, however at the time of sale or redemption necessary provision of capital gain tax shall apply</p>
